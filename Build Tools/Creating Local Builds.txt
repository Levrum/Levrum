Requirements - 

The following tools must be installed and their bin directories must be found in the %PATH% in order for the build script to work:

Java SE 11
Apache Ant
Visual Studio 2017 MS Build Tools
.NET Framework Developer Pack 4.7.2
InnoSetup 5

After installing them, run build.bat to produce a local build. Local builds are numbered the same as Jenkins builds, except the revision number will always be 9999. Enjoy!
